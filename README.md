# TOP Project #2
(09-12-25) Hello, everyone!

This is my second project with The Odin Project. In this project, I built a landing page according to the [layout](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png) provided by TOP, using HTML, CSS and Git. This isn't a functional webpage, but I had fun picking out a theme and arranging the layout. I also played around with a custom font, so hopefully it works properly! I think my CSS is also a little messy, but I don't feel like I know how to make it better yet.

Overall, this took about 5 hours.
